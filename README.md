#### Game Dev. Tools

+ [Mini JSON](https://github.com/MagellanicGames/minijson),  a small, lightweight JSON parser for C++.

+ [Tic80 Source Combiner](https://github.com/MagellanicGames/tic80SourceCombiner) Enables inclusion of other lua files (like in C/C++) to allow seperation of source files.

#### Other Tools

+ [Speedy HTML](https://github.com/MagellanicGames/SpeedyHtml) static website builder made in C#.  Very limited and massively suboptimal output but allows for quick page generation.  Used to generate my own website
+  [CS Micro MML](https://github.com/MagellanicGames/cs_mmml) a port of Micro Music Macro Language compiler to C#.

### What am I currently doing?

At the moment I'm indulging in some C++ projects.  Having spent the last 4 years developing games in a myriad of other languages I'm very much enjoying revising C++ development and tackling some of the problems game engines do for you.

Hopefully I'll find time to delve into emulation development and when I do I'll be sure to post it here.
